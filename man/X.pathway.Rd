\title{Generate a matrix of gene expressions in the presence of gene pathways}
\description{Generate a matrix of gene expressions in the presence of gene pathways (Scenario 2 of Emura et al. (2012)).}
\usage{X.pathway(n,p,q1,q2,rho1=0.5,rho2=0.5)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{the number of individuals (sample size)}
  \item{p}{the number of genes}
  \item{q1}{the number of genes in the first pathway}
  \item{q2}{the number of genes in the second pathway}
  \item{rho1}{the correlation coefficient for the first pathway}
  \item{rho2}{the correlation coefficient for the second pathway}
}
\details{
n by p matrix of gene expressions are generated. Correlation between columns (genes) is introduced to reflect the presence of gene pathways. The distribution of each column (gene) is standardized to have mean=0 and SD=1.
Two blocks of correlated genes (i.e., two gene pathways) are generated, where the first pathway include "q1" genes and the second pathway includes "q2" genes. The last p-q1-q2 genes are independent genes.
If two genes are correlated, the correlation is 0.5 (can be changed by option "rho1" and "rho2").
Details are referred to p.4 of Emura et al. (2012).
This deta generation scheme was used in the simulations of Emura et al. (2012), Emura and Chen (2016) and
Emura et al. (2017).
