\title{Univariate Cox score test}
\description{
Univariate significance analyses via the score tests (Witten & Tibshirani 2010; Emura et al. 2019) based on 
association between individual features and survival.
}
\usage{
uni.score(t.vec, d.vec, X.mat, d0=0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{t.vec}{Vector of survival times (time to either death or censoring)}
  \item{d.vec}{Vector of censoring indicators, 1=death, 0=censoring}
  \item{X.mat}{n by p matrix of covariates, where n is the sample size and p is the number of covariates}
  \item{d0}{A positive constant to stabilize the variance (Witten & Tibshirani 2010)}
}
\details{score test}
\value{
  \item{beta }{Estimated regression coefficients (one-step estimator)}
  \item{Z }{Z-value for testing H_0: beta=0 (score test)}
  \item{P }{P-value for testing H_0: beta=0 (score test)}
}
